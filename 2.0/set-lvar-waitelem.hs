{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

-- Here we define our own LVar using `PureLVar` and our own
-- `CartState` type, and do a threshold read of the cart.

-- `getPureLVar cart [Shoes, Book]` would be an illegal threshold set
-- because `Shoes` and `Book` have `Both` as their least upper bound.
-- But `[Shoes]` alone, for instance, would be fine.

-- For a fun time, uncomment the `threadDelay` calls.

-- This program raises occasional MVar exceptions due to a bug in
-- LVish.  This isn't a bug with the LVish interface but something
-- deeper and more sinister.
