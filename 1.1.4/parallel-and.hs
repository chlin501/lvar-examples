{-

This example differs from most of those in this repo because we're
defining our own LVar in it, rather than using one of the built-in
LVar data types from the Data.LVar.* libraries.

When we define our own LVars, we're writing code that might break
determinism, so if this were a real program, we'd probably isolate all
the code that might break determinism from the code that cannot.
(Perversely, the code that might break determinism is called the
"trusted code", while the code that can't is "untrusted".)

The blog post
http://composition.al/blog/2013/12/24/the-lvar-that-wasnt/ explains
what's going on here in detail.

-- define our own version of it.
import Control.LVish hiding (asyncAnd)

-- Now let's import some stuff we need to define our own LVar.  We'll

-- OK, we're ready to define the `Result` type: the type of the
-- result of a parallel logical "and" operation.

-- the join operation in our own code and declare `State` to be an
-- instance of `JoinSemiLattice`.
instance JoinSemiLattice State where
  join = joinStates

-- Additionally, `newPureLVar` takes a starting state as argument and
-- requires that it be an instance of `BoundedJoinSemiLattice`, so we

-- Now we're finally ready to define what the API to a `Result` will
-- be.  We should only be able to look at a `Result` when it's in one
-- of the two "exactly enough information" states: `TrueTrue` or `F`.
-- The definition of the `getResult` operation, which is written in terms of

getResult avr = getPureLVar avr [TrueTrue, F]

-- Now we can define an `asyncAnd` operation, which is the only way to
-- write to a `Result`.  It takes two values of type `Bool` (each
-- wrapped in a Par computation), creates a new LVar, launches two
-- threads that each write a `State` into the shared LVar, and finally
-- gets and returns the result.  If the result is neither `TrueTrue`
-- nor `F`, the `getResult` call will block.

{- The fishy part: This definition of `join` is not associative!

For associativity to hold, it has to be the case that

  x `join` (y `join` z) = (x `join` y) `join` z

However, according to the above definition of `join`, this is not the
case, because:

  TrueBot `join` (BotTrue `join` F) =
  TrueBot `join` F =
  F

  (TrueBot `join` BotTrue) `join` F =
  TrueTrue `join` F =
  Top

So our join-semilattice is not really a join-semilattice!

Now, the following are equivalent:

  (1) S is a join-semilattice.

  (2) For all elements x and y of S, the lub of the set {x, y} exists.

  (3) For all elements x, y, and z of S, the following properties hold:
  - Associativity: x `join` (y `join` z) == (x `join` y) `join` z
  - Commutativity: x `join` y == y `join` x
  - Idempotence: x `join` x == x

So it must be the case that (2) doesn't actually hold, even though we
wrote down the definition for `join`.  The `join` we wrote down must
not actually compute a least upper bound!

How can we tell if `join` actually computes a least upper bound?  It
would suffice for the following two properties to hold:

  * For all elements v1, v2, and v of S,
    if v1 <= v and v2 <= v, then (v1 `join` v2) <= v.

  * For all elements v1 and v2 of S,
    v1 <= (v1 `join` v2) and v2 <= (v1 `join` v2).

For us, the first of these does not hold! TrueBot <= F and BotTrue <=
F, but (TrueBot `join` BotTrue) == TrueTrue, which is not <= F.

Another way to put it: since `TrueTrue` and `F` are both upper bounds
of {`TrueBot`, `BotTrue`}, and neither `TrueTrue` nor `F` is less than
the other, then {`TrueBot`, `BotTrue`} doesn't actually have a lub,
regardless of what the definition of `join` claims it is.
